Cue: “Smallville” theme following one final channel change.


FRANK
Thought Bubble Audio and McFly Media Group present, “Save Me: The ‘Smallville’ Anthology.” Chapter Five: “The Test of a True Hero.” Written by Derek Russell and Tim Roe. And hosted by me, Frank Ramblings.


“Smallville” theme fades out.


FRANK
Smallville’s 10-year journey can be broken down into three acts: Act one is the high school years, seasons one through four. Act Two is Clark’s training and Lex’s descent into darkness, seasons five through seven. And Act Three covers Clark’s final trials and his journey towards embracing his destiny in seasons eight through ten. With the departure of series creators Al Gough and Miles Millar, this final act would be ushered in by new show runners - all of whom were Smallville veterans.


CRAIG BYRNE
“Fortunately, Bryan Peterson, Kelly Souders, Todd Slavkin, and Darren swimmer had been working on the show since season two.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“The budget of this show had some tightening at that point. And there were a lot of creative challenges as to how do we even make a show where somebody has to have superpowers - with limited resources, without a villain, without a love interest?”


TURI MEYER
“In a way, it forced us to really embrace what the show became, which is more of Clark Kent and the DC characters helping to influence his journey.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“We also had a little bit of freedom because people kept thinking, “Oh, it's going to be the last year” so whatever you do, you know you can't really screw it up because it's already going to be over. Just take a risk.”


FRANK
Having lost Lex, Lana, Kara, and Lionel - the series main cast was looking a little thin going into Season Eight. This would change with the announcement that fan favorite Justin Hartley would be joining the main cast as Oliver Queen - leading the Justice League on a search for Clark, who was missing after the season seven finale. Finding Clark in Russia without his powers, the group then searched one of Lex’s metahuman prisons for Chloe.


Clark would get his powers back after an incident where a mind-controlled Oliver shot him. John Jones flew Clark close to the Sun in a bid to heal him, and in doing so, Jones would lose his own abilities and be trapped in his human form. He would still help out and do good however, becoming a detective in the Metropolis PD. Season 2 through 7 had seen a handful of appearances from comic’s character Maggie Sawyer. While Sawyer herself wouldn’t appear in Season 8, Clark would meet her partner from the comics - Dan Turpin - when he investigated Jones getting shot in the line of duty by a dirty cop. It was also this episode which introduced Emil Hamilton as a doctor on retainer with the League, as Oliver knew that even though he looked human, Jones’ biology would likely shock hospital staff. 


Speaking of new characters, two new series regulars also joined the cast. First was Tess Mercer, Lex’s successor at LuthorCorp who it turned had had a history with Oliver.


BRIAN PETERSON
“Honestly, we went to the fan boards and looked at what fans really responded to that still is true to Clark's character and his growth - and it was other heroes, Oliver Queen and bringing in somebody who was not a replacement for Lex, but brought a really different energy to the whole Luthorcorp dynamic in Tess Mercer.”


FRANK
Portrayed by Cassidy Freeman, Tess was a woman fiercely devoted to Lex who had forced herself to become ruthless to survive. It would be revealed that at Lex’s direction, she had forced Lana to leave Clark his Dear John video and thanks to Lana’s influence in revealing that Lex had been manipulating her, she would shed that loyalty - doing the wrong things for the right reasons before ultimately becoming an ally to Clark and the other heroes. Tess’ character herself was an amalgamation of Miss Tesmacher - Lex’s girl Friday in the Donner films, Mercy Graves - and Lex’s bodyguard and assistant from Superman: The Animated Series.
And in season 10, it would be revealed that she was also Lex’s sister, Lutessa Lena Luthor.


CASSIDY FREEMAN
“When I first signed on to do Smallville, I don't think a lot of people knew what Tess was about. I think that they knew it was going to be a character that would have to grow, depending on how the series grew, and how long it would be on the air. 


I did not know that I was Lex’s sister, but the red hair and running Luthocorp and living in the mansion, were kind of telltale signs that could be a possibility. And I'm really glad that that's how it went. People meet me and they're like you're so bubbly and like not evil and angry and killing people. And I say “Why thank you, but you don't really know me.” For me, the most difficult part was playing someone very different than I am. I think I share some of her strength, but I think that she is much colder than I am. And so oftentimes, I was told to stop smiling. And that was difficult for me to do. Obviously.”


MICHAEL ROSEMBAUM 
“I think she’s a great character, Tess. She came in and just killed it.”


MICHAEL ROSEMBAUM - FANDOME
“Cassidy Freeman. I remember she called me, she's gotta be a little nervous going on to the show that's been on for years and I just talked about how great everybody was and how comfortable she'll be.”


TOM WELLING- FANDOME
“Such a mild mannered person, but when the camera rolled she was a force .Yeah, there was a scene where she had to like turn on that Luthor blood incensity, and I was like oh, this girl's gonna be alright. Like she's got it.”


FRANK 
Also joining the main cast would be Sam Witwer, who would later go on to play Darth Maul in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. He would portray Davis Bloome, a charismatic paramedic who would be horrified to uncover the dark secrets of his own origins.


DAVIS BLOOME
“I was sent here to destroy you, Clark…”


BRAINIAC - “ABYSS” 
“Soon, a new age will dawn on Earth ... an age of power and strength ... and the fall of the House of El. Doomsday is coming.”


GEOFF JOHNS
“All he wants to do is destroy Kryptonians. When you're the last Kryptonian, earth, pal, you're out of luck.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“Doomsday is the son of Zod who is the mortal enemy of Clark's own father. So he's basically the antithesis of Clark Kent in every way.”


BRIAN PETERSON
But what we were most excited about was adding the human element, well not really human, but the very cognizant element that hadn't really been in the mythology, the comics... and adding that element scared a lot of people, a lot of the fans at first.


FRANK
Due to Zod and his mate Faora’s inability to conceive a child, the two created the lab experiment that would become Doomsday - and secretly had it attached to Kal-El’s ship before he departed Krypton. It arrived camouflaged on earth as a boy who would be known as Davis Bloome. He too would land in the Smallville cornfields, but rather than being found by the Kents - he was found by minions of Lionel, who had hoped the boy was the Traveler. After the boy showed no signs of being remarkable, they abandoned him in the Suicide Slums section of Metropolis - where the boy transformed into the creature Doomsday for the first time. From there on, the boy would be bounced between foster homes throughout his life - the opposite experience to the warm and supportive family unit that Clark had with the Kents.


SAM WITER
“I'm absolutely a sci-fi nerd. When I was a kid, the only way my parents would get me to dress in a suit is if I wore a superman shirt underneath it. So I wasn't wearing a suit. I was Clark Kent. See, that's how that worked. So, I understand why it means so much to them.”


SAM WITWER 
“I know that there were a few people that were saying, ‘Well, why are they even calling it Doomsday? They just got this dude, you know, they're gonna call them Doomsday? That doesn’t make any sense.’ And I totally agree. Yeah, why call them Doomsday? If you're not going to do Doomsday?”


GEOFF JOHNS 
“When I first heard about Doomsday, I thought, “they cast a human as Doomsday?” obviously. And people were like, what is it? And I was like “What are they doing?” I didn't quite understand where they're going with it. And then I got in the room, and I heard all about it. And I thought it was awesome. Because in the comics, he you know, he was introduced, he killed Superman. He didn't have much else when he first showed up.” 


KELLY SOUDERS 
“Nobody just shows up as a killing machine. There's always steps to getting there. And so for us, it really was a blank slate to sort of delve into what would those steps be? How would they look? And how would they look on Smallville?”


SAM WITWER
“The way that I sort of approached Davis was that he was camouflage for the doomsday creature. He was a garment. And he was a garment that came to believe in himself, and had its own morality, which is a good morality, but it was in fact, just camouflage. And the moment he starts coming into contact with Clark, that facade starts cracking, and he is starting to discover terrible things about himself.”


KELLY SOUDERS  
“Smallville is all about fate and your destiny. And that's something that we've played with Clark all along. So when we started thinking about a villain this year, we all started thinking about him as he would relate to Clark Kent. And wouldn't it be interesting if their paths started together? And then over the course the time split apart? And what would that look like?”


TURI MEYER
“Well, actually, he started out I think, as a bartender right at first. When we started breaking the season, he was a bartender at the Ace of Clubs. And then the thought came around that What if he's, you know, saving people? What if he’s an EMT?”


BRIAN PETERSON
“Sam actually came on thinking he was a bartender, and then found out that he was in fact, an EMT, because as soon as somebody threw that out, we all latched on to it immediately.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“You know, we went to the EMT, because we thought - what a great contrast. He's saving people during the day and killing them at night. And he is a character that's constantly looking for redemption and is constantly looking to be saved.”


GEOFF JOHNS
“You know, he seems like a nice guy. And then he turns into Doomsday and so on surface level, you're like, well, how does that have anything to do with the comic book? And in reality, I think that giving him a human persona is cooler than the comic book. It's a cool addition, especially because he's personified somehow. And Doomsday has never really been personified. He's always been this hulking force, which is cool. But if you want to delve into it more, it's great to have that human side, as long as the human sides not really human.” 


KELLY SOUDERS
“Knowing that you're destined and you're fated to be a hero and somebody everybody was going to look up to - is not the worst, you know, revelation to have. But we wanted to explore what it would feel like if you discovered you were fated to be the devil.”


SAM WITWER
“The whole Davis Bloome thing is just, it's all camouflage. It's like a computer program that has started to believe in itself. And it's just not real at all. All it is it's camouflage. And it's camouflage that has a conscience, but it’s camouflage nonetheless.”


FRANK
When it came to bringing the creature proper to life? That was certainly a process.


KELLY SOUDERS 
“Developing Doomsday took a lot out of everybody's day. Took a lot out of Terezakis’ day, it took a lot out of our crew’s day, took a lot out of our day. the room just would come to a halt, as we all kind of tried to figure this out.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“All I can say is it really … it took a lot of painstaking work on everyone's part to make sure that that character felt as real in our world as possible.”




KELLY SOUDERS
“Well, when we first decided to jump in with Doomsday, we were excited and equally, absolutely terrified. Because to try and create something like that on television, I don't really know that it's been done in that same way before.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“It was a pretty big risk to bring Doomsday on. And we knew that we knew we would eventually have to be showing a monster for the first time in Smallville, which we had never really done.”


AL SEPTIEN
“For a while, we talked about just having Sam Witwer and just some kind of like crazy makeup or something. And at the end of the day, it was like, we felt we all felt that the fans would not respond as positively to that, as they responded to the actual creature that looks like the creature from the comic books.”


BILL TEREZAKIS 
“\When I was initially called to, to create the character of Doomsday. It all started off with a conversation with James Marshall. And James said, all we just want like a little, a little diamond on his cheek and, and it was a very glamorous description that he gave.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“All of us had a great deal of apprehension when it came to manufacturing this beast.”


BILL TEREZAKIS
“Something like this normally takes about five weeks. And I think in smaller we had just under two weeks to to create this character.”


KELLY SOUDERS  
Originally, we absolutely thought it would be CGI. 100% thought it would be CGI, that we wouldn't see Doomsday, really until the finale.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“And then by the time we got a few episodes, and we had to really make that final decision. Do we go CGI? Or do we do a prosthetic suit?”


KELLY SOUDERS 
“We knew that we wanted to see interaction between them, we had, we wanted to see them converse, we wanted to see them fall in love. We wanted to see them get angry at each other. And therefore a CGI just wasn't going to give us exactly what we wanted.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“The suit went through probably at least 20 different revisions and Bill Terezakis was very patient with us as we remove strands of hair here and put in one more spike here and made them less symmetrical here was a very arduous process.”


BILL TEREZAKIS
“And it was basically everybody had the same images that I'd emailed to everyone. So everybody, everyone was looking off the same images. And then from there, we sort of pieced in puzzle the elements that we liked, put it together in one character and then I was able to provide a concept that that everyone was happy with.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“Literally every possible detail was discussed. And the photos we got came in fingernails hands, arms, like came in piece by piece by piece until we finally got the final rendering.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“When we looked at the images the other very defining image of Doomsday is that he has bony protrusions that come across his eyes.”


BILL TEREZAKIS
“And the eyes had these cages of bone over top of it. So my concern with that was that if we were to cover the actor's eye with a bone prosthetic then we wouldn't have access to his contact lenses.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“Every once in a while in this job you have those days where everybody looks at each other and thinks is this real like is this really my job and I think the day that we started talking about how many bony protrusions are too many bony protrusions on Doomsday, that was one of those days.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“The bone on his chest was a huge discussion of how much it looked like an insignia, how much we should make it look natural, how much it should look like it just came out of him.”


KELLY SOUDERS  
“And then what should those bony protrusions look like? Should they look like scales? Should they look like bones? Should they you know, look like mountains jutting out of him..”


BRIAN PETERSON
“The hair was a huge conversation because Doomsday has a tuft of white hair. And every time we did it, it looked like he aged 60 years.”


KELLY SOUDERS  
“So there were a lot of conversations, but then it looked like it might look like plugs because you're not gonna have a full head of hair and get a big tough to know he did a few little strands and then we get rid of it all together.” 


BRIAN PETERSON
“We made a conscious choice to build a suit which takes only a couple hours to apply versus six hours of individual prosthetic bone spurs and all the makeup it would take to apply each of those things individually. So that was a choice we made to actually build the suit.”


BILL TEREZAKIS 
“The process is quite long, quite detailed and there's quite a few things that are working against this.”


TURI MEYER 
“But this is a full blown body suit with prosthetic everything, eyes, you know hands the whole deal and pull that off on the budgets that you work in television are very hard, very hard to do. But that was probably one of the reasons we took the approach on bride to have the videographer shoot a lot of footage that would be interspersed throughout the episode. 


The thought was early on while breaking the episode that by using that device if we had to we could hide the beast you know hide the shark as it were in the video and keep it all handheld flashes of images so that if we did not get to a place where you know especially the EP’s and and and everyone in posts were happy with how the beast was looking on HD we could always cut to that…”


KELLY SOUDERS
“The less you saw him at the beginning the better the more people's imaginations would jump to much more terrifying conclusions but I think actually Terezakis did a great job and when you actually see him he's just as terrifying as anything you could have ever imagined.”


AL SEPTIEN
“Okay, this is the first time we're going to see him Where do we where do we introduce him and the decision was made to introduce him at the wedding and to make him come in crash the wedding so that the lights would be dim and it was and there were a lot of shaft shafts of light as opposed to just a very well lit area shafts of light a lot of shadows a lot of corners where we could it were made it much more of a horror story, but that allowed us again to hide the monster if it didn't work out It turned out that it helped the mood of the whole piece it's great to have it that way but Bill Terezakis did such an amazing job that we were able to get I mean there are shots that are this close you know it's this close to the camera and the makeup looks phenomenal.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“I don't think we've ever had so many eyes from the network and the studio and every level on a character or a piece of film as we did that first day of dailies on Doomsday.”


GEOFF JOHNS 
“To see them stay true to it as best they could, and I think they did a great job, is pretty awesome.”


TURI MEYER
“It really rocked my world. when at the very end of “Bride” where Chloe is  being brought in Doomsday’s arms and you have the snow in the fortress. When I saw that I just thought this is this is like you know $80 million feature, and this is really amazing stuff, it doesn't get better than that. It was one of my proudest moments, probably a smaller scene.”


BILL TEREZAKIS
“I think we find a nice balance between an actual living version of the character and then what what also is depicted in the comic books.”


TURI MEYER
“To create a character in Davis that eventually became the monster that years and years down the road will kill Superman was rich with lots of storytelling. I think Al (Septien) and I came in with that paramedic idea. And once that hit, it was that the guy who saves lives, who is ultimately going to start taking lives - seemed to be the right sort of juxtaposition.”


JEPH LOEB
“Your hero was only as strong as your villain. And the attempt was always to try to create a villain who could somehow reflect something in Clark's life that Clark either didn't understand or the Clark had to grow from.”


AL SEPTIEN
“Clark is a hero that's struggling with that truth - how do you live up to that? And here's another guy who is the exact opposite, who's a villain inside and knows that that's his ultimate outcome. And Sam did an amazing job.”


SAM WITWER
“I think everyone loses their head or does something that makes them ashamed. And that is Davis all over the place. That's what that character is about. I think that’s why the audience responded to him.”


CHLOIAC
“You will eradicate the other Kryptonian and then the rest of the planet.”


DAVIS BLOOME
“I am not going to hurt anyone.”


CHLOIAC
“You have no free will, and you are destined to become what you really are. Doomsday.”


FRANK
Clark would finally reach an understanding with Jor-El this season. After he had entrapped Clark in the Fortress while Bizarro was on the loose, Clark had been hesitant to rebuild the Fortress after its collapse. But when it became apparent that Chloe had been infected with Brainiac and her memories faded, Clark had no choice but to take her to the Fortress for a sort of exorcism. 


CLARK KENT
“I’ll take it on like I have everything else.”


JOR-EL
“I am here for you as well, my son.”


CLARK KENT
“Thank you… father.”


FRANK
Unbeknownst to Clark however, this was all a part of Brainiac’s plan - to infect the Fortress, turning it dark and taking Jor-El offline for the remainder of the season. This would also tie into Chloe’s storyline for Season 8.


At the end of Season seven, lots of changes were in the air for the character of Clark’s best friend. Lex had fired her from the Daily Planet, Brainiac had infected her with his programming, and she was seemingly arrested by government agents. Those agents would turn out to be Lex’s minions, from whom Clark and Oliver would rescue her in the season premiere. She was also now engaged to Jimmy, and in spite of that, she would find herself drawn to Davis after a chance meeting. Initially it was the latent Brainaic within her that was drawn to Doomsday, but eventually Davis would also find himself emotionally drawn to Chloe, in spite of her commitment to Jimmy. 


Ultimately, Chloe and Davis realized she had the power to tame the beast within him. Before she learned his true nature, he was all one of the last things she could remember before Brainiac purged her memories. At Clark’s request, she would even briefly forget his secret - as Jor-El attempted to excise Brainiac from her body. Instead, he himself became infected - with the Fortress turning black, with Brainiac recounting Davis’ destiny to him and and preparing a chrysalis for him to make his final evolutions - a perverse parallel to Jor-El’s helping Clark along his trials. 


Jor-El would be successful in his exorcism, technically, prior to his own infection. Chloe would be infected once more though after Doomsday attacked her wedding at the Kent Farm and abducted her - bringing her to the darkened Fortress . 


Prior to the nuptials, she would try to push him away - which he didn’t take too kindly to. In spite of resistance, Davis couldn’t help but transform at the thought of losing her presence in his life.  At the wedding, Clark was to give Chloe away - as as her father disappeared from the show after season 3, not even returning for when his wife - played by former Wonder Woman Lynda Carter - made a guest appearance. 


Years later Al Septien jokingly suggested to a fan that he had died offscreen, but much like Lana’s biological father Henry Small, Lex’s second wife Helen, or Lionel’s illegitimate son Lucas… we may never know what truly became of them. 


As for what became of the the Chloe and Jimmy relationship? Even after Clark ‘rescued’ Chloe, their bliss would be short lived… if not nonexistent. To protect Clark, Chloe allowed her marriage to fall apart and get close to Doomsday - even when she learned the truth about him. Jimmy deduced that Davis was the serial killer that was plaguing the city - but was gaslit into thinking he was hallucinating due to pain meds he took after being attacked by the creature at the wedding. Feeling that Chloe had prioritized others in her life over him, Jimmy ended the relationship - and clued Tess in on Davis’ nature as a serial killer. 


CLARK KENT
“What are you doing?”


DAVIS BLOOME
“It’s my life, Clark. I can take it if I choose.” 


CLARK KENT
“Davis, don't be a martyr.”


CHLOE SULLIVAN
“That's not what this is, Clark.” 


DAVIS BLOOME
“I'm not doing this for you. I want this to end. I can't live with myself.”


CLARK KENT
“But it's not your fault. Everything that's happened to you is because of me. All right? We should have been brothers. Davis, you didn't have a home. If that would have happened to me ... I've always wondered what it would have been like ... If the Luthors had found me in that field. I could have turned out differently.”


DAVIS BLOOME
“But you didn't. You were destined to have the better life. No matter how hard we try to fight it, we will always return to our true nature. Chloe, pull the lever! Let me end this!”


CLARK KENT
“No, Chloe, you have to give this another chance. This is not set in stone.”


DAVIS BLOOME
“Enough, Clark. You know that you should let me die.”


CLARK KENT
“Davis, there has to be something in your life - Something that is worth giving it one more try.” 


CLARK KENT
“It isn't always about where your heart is. It's about what you've done and what you're going to do.”


FRANK
Realizing Davis’ true nature, Tess confronted Davis with the Kawatche prophecy - having learned of it from Lionel’s journals. She proposed that perhaps Davis, not Lex, was the true “Sageeth” - or villain - foretold by the prophecy. She also revealed Clark’s identity as the other Kryptonian, and Davis would then enlist Chloe to assist him in a suicide attempt using liquid kryptonite, after conventional methods failed. David ultimately survived, and Chloe would end up helping him hide. 


::Music shifts::


FRANK
Season eight would push Clark away from the grounding human presences in his life - with the exception of Lois, and amusingly his dog Shelby, whom he would still visit and feed at the farm despite residing at the Fortress. Even when he returned, Clark would have trouble expressing faith in his allies. After discovering Davis survived his suicide attempt, Clark had initially tried to send him to the Phantom Zone, but after an altercation in the Fortress - Chloe and Davis wound up on the run. Clark then thought that he could save Davis, by splitting him from the beast with black Kryptonite, allowing his human side to remain on Earth while the beast was banished. Unfortunately Davis started to transform after being detained by the Justice League, and Chloe was forced to split him there in that moment. Doomsday escaped into the streets of Metropolis, causing mayhem before being buried alive by Clark and the League. And while they were indisposed, Davis snapped upon learning that Chloe was with him only out of a desire to protect Clark. Though his victim would use the last of his strength to kill him and protect Chloe, Davis himself killed Jimmy in a fit of jealousy over Chloe’s affections.


Or should I say… he killed Henry.




CRAIG BYRNE
“Jimmy Olsen is supposed to be younger than Clark and Lois and. Aaron Ashmore, as their contemporary, kind of made things a bit muddy and confusing.


BRIAN PETERSON 
“The Jimmy Olsen character is something that will always be honestly a little bit of a heartbreak for me, because when he was brought on to the show, it was made clear because of his age difference because it didn't line up with the mythology we would have to show in some way that he wasn't the real Jimmy Olsen.”


FRANK 
Rather than being the James Batholomew Olsen of classic Superman lore, it was revealed that all along, Ashmore’s character had actually been that character's older brother: Henry James Olsen. Ashmore would appear as the “real” Jimmy in a flash forward in the series finale, feeling he deserved to be legitimized for his work. 


CHLOE SULLIVAN - “DOOMSDAY”
“You must be Jimmy’s little brother. Then this belongs to you… he’d want you to have it. Who knows. Maybe someday you'll follow in his footsteps.”


SAM WITWER
“That was no fun. Because I really like Aaron Ashmore. I really think he's a very good actor, and he's a cool guy. I begged the producers not to end it like that. But in any case, it isn't my job ultimately to agree or disagree.” 


FRANK
Witwer also felt it undermined the tragedy of Davis if he himself gave in and became just as evil as the beast. Witwer would also be leaving the show… a move that was initially unexpected by the show’s production staff. The episode “Bloodline” had established that Davis resembled his “father” General Zod, and Witwer had initially signed a contract that gave him the option to return for another year should the show be renewed for Season Nine. Something which nobody honestly expected at the start of the season.


SAM WITWER
“Season eight was supposed to be it. Then we started airing. The fans said, Okay, all right. This is interesting. They started getting into it. And our ratings went up. And so suddenly, you know, Warner Brothers looks and goes, Okay, why are we stopping?”


FRANK
Though Witwer portrayed Zod in the closing moments of the Season Eight finale, his face was not shown in the broadcast version of the episode. He ultimately passed on the opportunity to stay on, feeling it would be difficult for both fans and the characters within the show to accept him portraying another character after what Davis had done. 


SAM WITWER - ROBIN BURDGE
“I was just like: 'So, you're telling me that this guy looks exactly the same, and we've already established that Davis Bloome's likeness is all over Metropolis as a serial murderer in the newspapers and Chloe would never be around this guy after he's killed Jimmy Olsen. Do you realize how badly you've pinned yourself in a corner?' I was very flattered by the offer to continue with the show, but it didn't entirely make sense to me and I thought they'd do better to find someone else. I hope I didn't piss anyone off, because I think that they were surprised. I had a really great time on that show and...they killed my character. I signed on to play Davis Bloome and I loved that character, and if Davis is not there well...that's what I agreed to do.”


FRANK 
Another major change in Season 8 would be where, and how, the show was filmed. With Metropolis becoming the primary setting, it was no longer cost effective to shoot all the Metropolis scenes on location as they had in years prior.


GLEN WINTER
“We went on location less, and we built a backlot and our backlot represented Metropolis.”


KEVIN FAIR 
“We didn't use film anymore. We went digital, but it looked awesome.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“Digital HD, we knew that there were some difficulties with day at that time - making the show darker, shooting at night more than the daytime. Giving a sense of shadows.”


FRANK
This season would also see the resolution to Kara’s story - for now - as Laura Vandervoort returned for the episode “Bloodline.” The Fortress crystal - which had been missing since the season 7 finale - was anonymously sent to the Kent Farm, and had been reprogrammed, sending Clark and Lois to the Phantom Zone. It was here they would reunite with Kara, who had refrained from using Jor-El’s failsafe out of fear of releasing criminals like Clark had done in season six. Once freed, she would quickly set off on another mission.


KARA
“I'm leaving Smallville.”
 
CLARK
“Kara, you just got back.” 


KARA
“When I was in that Hell hole, I heard rumors that Kandor still exists. Kal-El, I think that a part of our civilization may have survived before the explosion. If I can find that city, I can save our bloodline.”


CLARK
“Then I’ll go with you.” 


KARA
Kal-El, there is a reason that you were sent to Earth and raised as a member of the Kent family. Your path is on Earth, living amongst the humans and inspiring mankind.”
 
CLARK
“I’m gonna miss you.” 


KARA
“You’re always with me. Close to my heart.”


FRANK
Lois, for her part, wouldn’t remember the adventure, as she would be briefly possessed by the phantom of Zod’s wife, Faora.


FRANK 
Season Eight would also see Clark start working at the Daily Planet - a move he made on Lois’ recommendation. She had initially thought Clark would start working in the mail room, but after Clark saved Tess’s life from DC comics baddie “Plastique” on his first day, Tess wanted to keep an eye on him, so he was assigned a desk opposite Lois in the basement bullpen.


CLARK KENT - ODYSSEY 
“You’re looking at the latest recruit to the Daily Planet. Looks like we’re gonna be neighbors, Lane.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“What’s amazing to us is to watch each of the actors grow into their roles as much as the characters have their own arcs. And Erica, episode by episode, just became more the Lois Lane we all know. And it was almost seamless. And you don’t even feel that it’s happening, you just watch it.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“A lot of the time the dirty secret is that you write to the actor. You write to what they’re capable of, you write to their strengths - and I have to say, not only just of Tom but of our entire cast, I’ve never done that because no matter what I throw at them I know that they’ll surprise me and give me something even better than what I was expecting.”


KEVIN FAIR
“Tom has been Clark Kent for ten years, and he knows who Clark is better than anybody.”


TOM WELLING 
“Clark has to figure out who he is, himself, and that he doesn’t have to be anyone else. And I think that it’s finding that within himself which will help him move in to becoming who we all know he’ll be.” 


FRANK
With Kristin Kreuk’s Lana no longer part of the core cast, Clark and Lois would start to grow closer and see each other in a new light.


CRAIG BYRNE
“From the very first Superman comic book in 1938, Clark had a thing for Lois Lane - so it was inevitable that eventually the series would get the two of them together.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“You can't then force him to fall in love, and especially when he was so in love with Lana. You know Tom was also right on this, Clark Kent cannot be the kind of person that just dumped somebody and falls in love with somebody else. And so he went through a long several year process of kind of gradually respecting Lois and falling for her in a romantic way.”


KEVIN FAIR
“I did a show called ‘Stiletto’ and Lois was talking to the Blur, but she didn't know it was Clark. So I had to do the sequence where they were talking on the phone together. I think I shot it at like six o'clock in the morning, because it's the last thing I did. And I shot his stuff by himself, and I shot her outside, and she had been up all night. So I'm like, I don't know if this is actually gonna work-  but then when the camera rolled on her, she was there. And it was beautiful. And I think that was voted best scene of the Year by the fans like everybody loved it.”


GLEN WINTER  
“It became a much more intimate show about Lois and Clark, they're blossoming romance. But the lighting has gotten a little more sophisticated. It's a little more subtle…”


MAIRZEE ALMAS  
“We would often use very, very, very long lenses. So that when Clark is looking at Lois, everything around them blurs out.”


FRANK
But again, Clark wouldn’t be the only man catching Lois’ attention this season. Well, actually, he would be, but she didn’t know that.


CHLOE
“Clark Kent, the unassuming journalist… but when he’s playing hero-“


CLARK
“He steps out of the shadow into his red and blue, creating two completely separate identities?”


FRANK
When Clark saved Lois and Jimmy from a mugging, Jimmy had captured the rescue on camera. Though Clark only appeared as a red/blue blur, it prompted him to create and maintain a dual identity. In the episode, appropriately titled “Identity,” Jimmy briefly deduced Clark’s secret. In an effort to throw him off the trail, Clark called in a favor that Oliver Queen owed him. Back in Season 6, when Lois suspected that Oliver might be the Green Arrow, Clark took up the hood and the bow while Oliver stood nearby, putting Lois’s suspicions to rest. Now, Clark would ask Oliver to return the favor in front of Jimmy.


Though the ruse worked, and Jimmy put his theory aside, the close call inspired Clark to be more careful with his secret, and to craft a true dual identity for the first time in the series. Though he had mostly set aside flannel in favor of a shirt and tie for his new job at the Planet, his classic red jacket/blue shirt combo stuck around for his heroics. The episode “Turbulence” even ended with him making a quick change in a phone booth.


As for Jimmy, Clark would ultimately come clean and apologize [shortly] before the photographer’s ultimate demise. 


CLARK KENT
“Jimmy... I am the red-blue blur. You were right. About me and about Davis. You were the only person to put it all together. I'm sorry that I lied to you.”


JIMMY OLSEN
“I knew it. [ Laughs ] I was so right!”


CLARK KENT
“Look, Jimmy, I need your help. Do you trust me?”


JIMMY OLSEN
Always, C.K.


FRANK
The declaration of trust and friendship made Jimmy’s loss even more devastating for Clark. He soon ditched the red and blue, rebranding simply as The Blur. The outfit, all black with a silver S painted on the shirt - could perhaps be seen as an homage to the suit that Superman wore after being killed by Doomsday in the comics. While Clark would bury the beast alive, setting the stage for their future rematch - the last son of Krypton  himself would live, but abandon his Clark Kent identity. Heading North, he would bring Jor-El back online and finally, willingly, begin his training.


CLARK KENT
“I've always tried to forget I was an alien. Or a creature. I've always tried to pretend I was human. I was raised to believe it was my Kryptonian part that was dangerous, Chloe, but I was wrong. It's my human side. It... it's the side that gets attached, the side that makes decisions based on emotions. That's my enemy. And Davis proved that to me.”
         
CHLOE SULLIVAN                 
“So, because of some psychopath, you're gonna cut the rest of us out of your life? Clark... human emotion is what made you the hero that you are today.”         


CLARK KENT
“They're what's stopping me from being the hero I could be. It's what the world needs now.”         


CHLOE SULLIVAN
“What are you saying?”         


CLARK KENT
“Clark Kent is dead. ”


BRIAN PETERSON
“We took a lot of heat for ending season eight with Clark in a dark place, but if you follow any hero’s journey there is a darkness, there is a place that propels them into greatness. And we planned on season nine being that dark year. But it was a risk, it was absolutely a risk to have the iconic S - but on a black shirt with a black jacket.”


CLARK KENT 
“I gave up everyone who was important to me. I wear the symbol of our family everyday to remind me that I have a different destiny.”


JOR-EL 
“Perhaps you've tried to move on too quickly. The test of a true hero is to struggle with feelings of loss and to overcome them, not to avoid them.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“We wanted to go with a darker feeling, we wanted it to look very different from the sunny poppy fields that we started with in Smallville.”


DANNY FINGEROTH
“They could have really annoyed an audience, like ‘put on the costume already, what are you waiting for?” But that maybe makes it more identifiable to a modern audience, that he’s not wearing a strict specific uniform.”


FRANK
In the wake of Jimmy’s untimely death, the Justice League temporarily disbanded - and Clark headed North to begin his training at the Fortress. He had his faith in humanity shaken, because it was the human side of Doomsday that killed Jimmy - the side that Clark adamantly believed was worth saving. It didn’t help that Clark also became disillusioned by Chloe and Oliver: Chloe had protected Davis during his killing spree, and Oliver had seemingly killed Lex! Lex had resurfaced, portrayed by a body double covered in bandages and hooked up to life support after the collapse of the Fortress. He had enlisted disgruntled former Queen employee Winslow Schott, also known as Superman villain Toyman, to plant Kryptonite bombs around Metropolis in a revenge plot against Oliver. Oliver got the upper hand by placing one of Winslow’s bombs where Lex had been hiding, killing Lex when it went off. 


That episode, “Requiem”, also saw the final appearance of Kristin Kreuk’s Lana Lang. Having returned in the mid-season finale, she was also on the hunt for Lex, when she was found by Oliver.


He persuaded her to come back to Smallville for Chloe and Jimmy’s wedding. She arrived just in time to interrupt a near-kiss between Lois and Clark. Feeling wounded and discouraged, Lois would accompany Jimmy to STAR City for emergency surgery after Doomsday’s attack on the wedding.


A few episodes later, Lana hijacked Project Prometheus, a prototype that Lex had been developing to aid his own recovery - which took inspiration from the classic LexCorp Warsuit of comic book lore. Prometheus was a more advanced model - almost a second skin that involved nanites being injected into Lana’s skin. This would also give her enhanced speed and strength of her own, and for a brief time she and Clark were happy together - until Lex’s revenge scheme was unveiled. Bombing Luthorcorp executives that had approved a merger with Queen Industries was actually all a plot to lure out Lana and Clark. Lana could deactivate the Kryptonite bombs, but her nanite power suit would permanently absorb Kryptonite radiation. The star-crossed lovers had come full circle -- in the pilot, Clark couldn’t get close to Lana because of her Kryptonite necklace. Eight years later, the Kryptonite-infused Prometheus suit made it impossible for them to be together, putting an end to their romance for good.


Season Eight added some classic but low-key Superman supporting characters, like Emil Hamilton, Dan Turpin, Maxima, and Bruno Manheim - along with supervillains like Plastique, Livewire, Parasite, and Neutron - as Tess formed the Injustice League as a test for Clark.


The mid season premiere topped all of them though - as the show brought in a staple of “young Superman” stories - the Legion of Superheroes.


COSMIC BOY
“Long live the Legion.”


FRANK 
The episode was the first of four to be penned by DC Comics writer Geoff Johns - and featured Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl, and Lightning Lad  - heroes from the 31st Century who were inspired by Superman. They would assist him in freeing Chloe from the possession of Brainiac, who had downloaded his consciousness into her mind and had been slowly taking her over throughout the season. At episode’s end they took what was left of Brainiac with them into the future to be reprogrammed into “Brainiac 5”, but not before leaving Clark with a Legion ring which would allow him to travel through time. This would come into play in the episode “Infamous”, which saw him come forward with his secret while facing blackmail from a returning meteor freak. As his life and those of his loved ones spiraled out of control, he used the ring to go back and capture the villain - who would inadvertently be killed by Davis in the revised timeline. Given his past experience with time travel in Reckoning,  Clark wouldn’t often utilize the ring - actually destroying it after “Infamous.” In the season finale’s cold open however, Cosmic Boy would make a cameo return - gifting Clark a new one and offering a warning. Because they had saved Chloe from Brainiac, the future had changed. Clark would defeat Doomsday - but at the cost of his own life. Cosmic Boy urged Clark to send Davis to the future where the Legion would try their best to detain him, but Clark declined - feeling it was his responsibility. Delaying his own death - Doomsday was buried alive, setting the stage for an inevitable rematch. Cosmic Boy’s warning also came true - from a certain point of view - as Clark abandoned his human identity. And The new Legion ring would still come into play- facilitating a cliffhanger when Lois found the ring and disappeared, only to return months later in the Season 9 premiere with no memory of what happened to her. 




SETH GREEN - ROBOT CHICKEN 
“You’re that white rap kid from 90210! You’re Brian Austin Green!”


::cue that Brian Austin Green ska song::


FRANK 
The first two episodes of season nine would see the introduction of the character John Corbin, and his transformation into the villain Metallo. Corbin would be played by Brian Austin Green, of Beverly Hills: 90210 and who had just broken out of that “David Silver” mold with Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.


BAG 
“I wasn’t a huge Superman fan as far as the comics went - I loved the films. I was a big Christopher Reeve fan, the show was on when I was younger - because I’m an older gentleman. My son knew the character and he was really excited when I was talking to him about it. And then on top of it, to be honest, coming off of Sarah Connor? And having the fans that I had from that?  I really felt like I wasn’t done with the genre… for me it was much more exciting that I was going to step in and play this comic book character that everyone knows… it really meant a lot to me, both the fans and the genre itself. But it’s really not until you’re there and you’ve got the prosthetics on - which - we had shot a lot of the stuff without the prosthetics. The scenes where I was wearing a jacket or whatever. So no one saw really just how brutal they were going to be, but I had been meeting with special effects and I had seen sort of the preview pictures and I knew it was sort of a very painful thing. So I knew that had to be a part of it, it’s a guy who’s like, slowly dying throughout the episode. Once I was there and I had the prosthetics and stuff on, it was really easy to do. It was all uncomfortable to move in, I was bandaged. It was like what reality is - if you woke up on a table and your innards had been removed and replaced with copper piping and tin cans. So they were choices, but again, Mairzee, who directed the episode, was fantastic. We worked really well together, and I’m glad it turned out alright. I was on set, and I wasn’t expecting to come do Smallville and have it be on such a grand scale. I know that just with a network like the CW alone, they’re much more limited than what Sarah Connor was. You know Tom Welling and I were talking one time, and he was saying he’s really proud of the fact it’s like these little movies that are made every week. We were on set talking about every single thing we needed to, just to make sure it all made sense before we started shooting.”


FRANK 
After defeating Metallo at the end of the episode, Clark would return to the Planet - where his grounding dynamic with Lois would start to reaffirm his connection to humanity. Corbin for his part had been a former war correspondent brought in to replace Clark when he walked away from his Clark Kent identity. John sought vengeance against the Blur, after the hero saved a prison bus - only for a prisoner to escape and murder his sister. 


METALLO 
“WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT?! To interfere with our lives - and change our fate?!”


FRANK 
His Kryptonite heart affected his adrenal glands and mental state, problems which would be fixed when he returned later in the season. Presented as a sort of antihero, making peace with Lois Lane. Green hinted at a cut ending for the episode, which had left it open for a return appearance in season 10. Despite Green’s willingness, Metallo would only appear again in a cameo portrayed by a body double - something which he speculates may have been due to his criticism of his last episode - which featured a benevolent Corbin enlisting Lois to help him start fresh, before being sent by Tess and Chloe to stop Clark and Zod after the former was infected by Red Kryptonite.


BAG 
“It’s a bit of a letdown. It was a bit more of a frazzled script than Metallo. I was a bit more unsure of what we were doing completely. There were parts of scenes that didn’t make it, which just in reading up…  it was a big plot hole. I got the script maybe three or four days before I flew up to Vancouver, and I had a lot of those same questions. It was one of those situations… I really liked John Corbin in Savior, and I really liked the script for Metallo. I really liked where they went with it, and just sort of the progression of the character. At the point he was rebuilt, he did not understand and was angry about it, not knowing what it was for. Then feeling like he had figured something out and that it was divine intervention because he could then stop the Blur. It was a bit lost in this episode. I was a little confused by the reasoning of wanting to bring Metallo back for the purpose they had. I had sort of hoped that he would come back for his third episode and it would be sort of his anger over finding out who had done to him what was done - which would create more anger. And I think Metallo to me always seemed like sort of a building rage, and this train, that once he got himself started - he couldn’t stop. The angrier he got, the angrier THAT made him.  Sort of this perpetual motion engine. And it took a bit of a different turn… they never really established if John Corbin actually knows who really did anything to him. There’s a part of me that hopes they call and say they want Metallo to come back so that I can sit down with them. My big concern was I want fans of the comic and fans of the character to say that’s the Metallo I always wanted to see and that was cool, no matter what the budget is and whatever. I wanted to make sure that was covered. The one thing that I think was accomplished that was very good was the closure between John Corbin and Lois Lane. I think that was a good idea, you got to see them bond and get one last glimpse of John Corbin the man - since you didn’t get much of him in Savior. They had an ending which I think was the set up for the return of the Metallo everyone had dreamed of seeing. He made a decision by himself on the street corner that ended the episode initially in the script. It involved that mind control chip, he put the mind control chip in his neck on his own and decided to give up on humanity in what was scripted. In what we had I was standing on the corner with the red kryptonite heart, I was wearing it and put the chip in. I’m not sure why they chose to cut that, and they probably didn’t want me talking about it.”


FRANK 
While the episode in question, “Upgrade” saw Corbin receive upgrades courtesy of Luthorcorp - his initial cybernetic enhancements at the hands of the recently arrived Zod’s minions.


OMEGAHEDRON - INJUSTICE 
“You will be the savior of Kandor.”


FRANK
Tess had found the Kryptonian orb that Lex had brought with him to the Fortress. The whispers that Kara had heard in the Phantom Zone were not unfounded. It would turn out the orb contained DNA samples of the Kandorian army - and was capable of producing clones - with Zod’s being the first to emerge in the final seconds of the season eight finale. Again, Zod in season nine wouldn’t be portrayed by Witwer as originally intended - but by British actor Callum Blue.


::Zod Archive Audio to be spliced in throughout below::


BRIAN PETERSON
“We've kind of been teasing Zod for several seasons now. In the first version, we went with an incarnation where he was a disembodied entity in the Phantom Zone. But we also really wanted to see him in the flesh. And so we needed to think of a way to bring him back, where we can see his full figure in his body.”


CALLUM BLUE 
“He is a clone from the real General Zod, and he didn't even know what happened to General Zod as he is he, you know, lived his life after I come to Earth.”


ZOD
“None of you recall that tragic day. Because the moment your blood was taken was the last moment you remember a candle that I can assure you, I have not forgotten.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“To go back in time and sort of find out how he ended up being that evil guy that we all love to hate..”


BRIAN PETERSON
“We wanted to create a character that you could believe would turn into the Terence Stamp character from the Donner movies.”


CALLUM BLUE
“I used to watch Superman II when I was a kid all the time, and used to be terrified of him. Absolutely terrified of the Terence Stamp portrayal. And so um, you know, it was both a great thing and a bit of a ‘Whoa, I've got some big shoes to fill’, you know.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“We really wanted to show a Zod that would grow into the Terence Stamp character, and we wanted to somewhat like Al and Miles had done with Lex to start him at a different place. The show's always been in a weird way about brotherhood, you know, Lex and Clark, Oliver and Clark - that we thought it'd be interesting to have Zod come to earth as somebody who actually wants desperately to have a brother in arms in Clark.”


ZOD
“Do you really think there's redemption for what I did?”


CLARK KENT
“It's never too late.” 


ZOD
“How can you be so sure?”


CLARK KENT
“Because I killed my own father.”


CALLUM BLUE
“It's a very weird, complex, beautiful relationship, really. We want to kill each other, and be each other's father and son, you know, in a way.”


ELISABETH GEHELEIN - DC EDITOR
“Zod started off not as a bad guy, Zod was a hero on krypton, he was this very forceful military presence.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“I think for the most part, the character that has been created on Smallville is the person that comes to earth and Superman II.”


ELISABETH GEHELEIN - DC EDITOR
“By bringing Zod into the world of Superman as another Kryptonian you get a lot of emotional resonances with Superman that you wouldn't from anyone else because he's looking at a piece of his homeworld gone horribly wrong.”


RICHARD DONNER
“Any good conflict in both writing or visual entertainment. I mean, you need, you need those two people you need the, if the adversary wasn't worthy of the hero, you wouldn't care.”


GEOFF JOHNS
“His motivation is a little bit more of protecting his people, rather than just ruling. He wants to rule his people, but he wants to help them survive and our backstory that Dick and I went into a little bit more in depth with in the comics, Zod - Jor-El discovered that the planet was going to be destroyed and Zod said, I believe you.”


MATT IDELSON - DC EDITOR
“He became a guy who heard where Jor-El was coming from, that the planet was doomed and agreed that the council wasn't listening. And whereas Jor-El would take the kind of normal, sane approach and say, ‘Hey, this is a problem. Listen to me.’ Zod said ‘let's just kill the council and take power of the planet and then find a solution before any more time goes by.’”


GEOFF JOHNS 
“And Jor-El says ‘we can't go and take over the council, because we won't have the capacity to do anything about it. People won't listen to us it'll be anarchy.’ And so Zod said ‘I'm going to do anyway.’ So Jor-El was looking for a real way to save the world and the people, and Zod was Zod. He was looking for violence as the way - it wasn't the way, but he can always have that if Jor-El had just listened to me, we could have saved Krypton.”


MATT IDELSON - DC EDITOR
“When he came out of the Phantom Zone. All that anger towards the council and Jor-El was displaced onto Superman because there was no one else left to take it out on.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“We always tried to pull inspiration from all the different incarnations from the mythology, and we wanted to be true to this Terence Stamp kind of version from the Richard Donner films. We also knew that there were a lot of different versions...”


ELISABETH GEHELEIN - DC EDITOR
“There was Zod in a pocket universe, and there was a you know, Soviet Zod…”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“The version that we wanted to put on screen was somebody who had a second chance at life and started as a Major Zod rather than a General Zod.”


GEOFF JOHNS 
“Well, the best villain is a villain that you can relate to. There's two kinds of villains. There's the Joker, who's insane and fun to watch, and then there's guys like General Zod -  who, who actually believe that the ends justify the means. And once you understand those motivations, the actions seem a lot clearer. And you buy into what they're doing a lot more.”


MATT IDELSON - DC EDITOR
“I think Callum Blue does an amazing job playing Zod. It's totally how I would see the character as a younger man with a little more energy and a little bit more vibrance as opposed to that cold calculating Terran stamp portrayal. But I can totally see one falling into the next very easily. That line, kneel before Zod - is so great. And Terence Stamp is just cool.”


ELISABETH GEHELEIN - DC EDITOR
“When he says kneel before Zod - it is in no way a suggestion. And it's almost like he doesn't even have to say it. He knows you're going to do it.”


GEOFF JOHNS
“You've seen t-shirts with Kneel before Zod -  you've seen the stickers, you've seen like people know the generals idea. You don't really see people wearing Lex Luthor shirts. You know, and that's says something.”


TERENCE STAMP
“That's magic to me that I was at the beginning of something, you know. KNEEL BEFORE ZOD.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“I think kneel before Zod to him started out meaning ‘give me respect’, because of his position as a major, and then a general, and the line between that and ‘serve me’ got blurred.”


GEOFF JOHNS 
“He's aloof. He's higher than you. He'll lead you to greatness. But you need to bow first.”


BRIAN PETERSON 
“So we originally were never going to use the phrase in the premiere. We had a lot of conversations and we thought it would be… at first we wrote just the word ‘kneel’ and he was gonna say kneel. And so we created kneeling as the Kandorian salute. So what he actually had originally started saying was ‘salute me’ and then that got bastardized in his kind of megalomaniac quest for power. So we were just gonna say kneel, and then we realized there is no way we can withhold that from the fans. They have to hear him saying Kneel Before Zod.


ZOD
“Salute. Kneel. kneel before Zod.


BRIAN PETERSON
So it made it into the premiere and when they showed it at comic con, like literally you felt chills because the audience just went crazy. It was awesome.”


TERENCE STAMP 
I know the people who identify with Zod. They're kind of bad boys. 


ELISABETH GEHELEIN - DC EDITOR
“Well, he's a total badass.”


CALLUM BLUE 
“He knows exactly what he wants and he's very clear and focused about what he wants and that always makes a great villain.”


RICHARD DONNER 
I don't know what else I can say about him except don't screw with Zod. Bow to Zod.


FRANK
When they first emerged from the kryptonian orb, Zod and his followers had no idea how they had arrived on the planet or why they didn’t have abilities under a yellow sun.


AL SEPTIEN
“The choice led by Brian Kelly, not to give the kryptonians powers early on was really smart, and gave us a lot of story allowed that group of kryptonians to split and make their own choices… and then really gave them the opportunity to see who Zod was and see the villain that Zod was.”


CALLUM BLUE
“I think it just brings such a great human quality to him, you know, you know, behind every villain behind every dictator, the core of them is so insecure and hates themselves so much that they want to be seen in this world. As somebody who can overtake the world. You know, there's there's a human element. And I think it's really important to bring that in.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“And it's really fascinating to watch somebody who's that vulnerable, but so crafty at manipulation, and has such a sense of what power really means that he can pull it together in moments where he really needs it.”


FRANK
As it would turn out, they were clones of Kandor’s army - who only had memories of up to the point their blood was taken for the experiment. They had been unaware of Krypton’s destruction, and with the exception of Zod - that of Kandor’s in the decades prior. 


CASSIDY FREEMAN 
“Something that I thought was interesting in the first episode, when they brought Zod out, is the fact that they started right off the bat with his people turning on him. Which I thought was a really interesting thing.” 


KELLY SOUDERS 
“I find him most fascinating and scenes where you know, he's very vulnerable. And he's trying very, very hard to keep up a powerful front.”


ZOD
“You dare defy me? I have saved the lives of half of the soldiers in this room. I have always been true to my word. And I will find the answers we are looking for or I will die in the quest!”


KELLY SOUDERS 
“It first started in the first episode in his scene where he's with tests in the bedroom. And there's a little bit of a throwdown.”


TESS MERCER 
“I was told that you would come here and save this planet from its own destruction. But you don't even know what you're doing here. Do you?”


KELLY SOUDERS 
“You see how strong he is, and Tess is kind of terrified of him. But when she's not looking, we see these little moments in his expression that tell us the guy is out to sea without a ship. And there's a part of him that's completely horrified about what he's going through.”


CASSIDY FREEMAN
“And we have to figure out whether or not we're going to trust each other. And whether or not who is really in power between the two of us. Callum's great, Callum's a really nice guy and I'm glad I'm glad that he came to the cast this year. It's fun to have someone different, you know someone that's done other shows that knows what it's like to be in that kind of family.”


FRANK
It would be revealed that like Clark and Lex, Jor-El and Zod had started out as friends - with Major Zod, not yet a General, even saving Jor-El’s life on one occasion. Zod had hoped that Jor-El would repay his debt by cloning his first wife and son,after their deaths at the hands of a terrorist group. When Jor-El refused, a rift formed between the two friends.


BRIAN PETERSON
“The perceived betrayal of Zod's best friend really led to him being the villain that he became.”


KELLY SOUDERS
“We wanted to bring sort of a history between Zod and Joe-El that we hadn't seen before.”


ZOD
 “My accomplishments pale in comparison to this man's.”


MATT IDELSON - DC EDITOR
“How interesting it would be to find out that Jor-El was very much responsible for Zod turning into the evil guy that we know… 


JOR-EL
 “I, Zod, am in your debt.”


ZOD
 “Never forget that my friend.”


BRIAN PETERSON
“Would he have been a villain anyway? Was it because of what happened between those two friends that Zod became who he became?”


ZOD
“My son... my wife.”


JOR-EL
“There's nothing you can do. kandor is gone.”


FRANK
This only worsened when Zod learned that Jor-El had also been cloned by the orb - and that he was responsible for Zod’s clone army not having powers under the yellow sun.


The Jor-El clone, played by actor Julian Sands, gave another rare look at the humanity of Clark’s birth father - as the AI’s coldness and occasional malevolence had his knowledge, but not his personality. Sands would make one more appearance alongside Helen Slater’s Lara in the final season, where he would explain that the Fortress AI was designed to preserve his knowledge - but not his flaws or ego. 


Clark would sadly only meet his father’s clone in time to watch him die in his arms - as he would be killed by a rogue soldier in Zod’s army. The same soldier, Alia, had come back from the future with Lois after her sudden disappearance caused by the Legion ring in the season 8 finale.


Lois had been transported to an alternate future where Zod’s army reigned supreme over humanity - as they had built solar towers that converted the yellow sun radiation red - counteracting the effects of the blue Kryptonite and in turn robbing Clark of his powers. Clark would ultimately destroy these two towers - thus preventing the dystopian future.


While Lois wouldn’t retain her memories of what happened in the future; Tess had Lois abducted in an effort to uncover her memories with advanced technology. Clark would also witness them when he swooped in to save Lois, and at the end of the episode - the two would finally become an official couple, after months of building sexual tension.


LOIS LANE - DISCIPLE
“Clark Kent and Lois Lane? Who knew?”


CLARK KENT
“I did.”


FRANK
Speaking of relationships, Chloe would soon explore a new romance, too. After being cured of Brainiac in Season Eight, and still mourning Jimmy’s death, she shut herself into the Watchtower to cope - as the loft at the top of a skyscraper had been a wedding present from Jimmy. She embraced her transition from reporter to Watchtower - the coordinator and “woman in the chair” for the Justice League; a Barbara Gordon computer wiz type. In the early years at the Torch, Chloe was sort of a proto Veronica Mars (ironically, Kristen Bell had auditioned for Chloe) but now that role of investigator was behind her and she had taken on the role of a proto Felicity Smoak. And much like Felicity, Chloe would find herself in a relationship with Oliver Queen. 


Wracked with guilt over Jimmy’s death, Oliver briefly retired the hood and quiver, and went into a downward spiral, turning to alcohol and fight clubs. He hit rock-bottom when the Toyman resurfaced, laying a trap to force Oliver to admit his involvement in Lex’s apparent death. Overcome with guilt, Oliver willingly stepped off a pressure plate he believed was rigged to explode, fully expecting to be killed. Realizing the depths of Oliver’s despair, Chloe organized a sort of intervention with the support of the Justice League - orchestrating events to help Oliver rediscover his inner hero. 


OLIVER QUEEN
“I just started asking myself who knew about Lex, about Toyman ... the things I'd given up, what I tried to do. Then it all occurred to me. Dinah shattered the glass in the warehouse, Bart rescued me from the car, Victor faked the computers, and Watchtower kept an eye on the whole thing. Right?”


CHLOE SULLIVAN
“You were living like you had a death wish, Oliver. You had to face your demons if you were ever gonna make it out alive, and I had to push you over the ledge in order to pull you back.”


OLIVER QUEEN
“Did Clark know about this?”


CHLOE SULLIVAN
“You can't be serious. Clark would never in a million years risk what needed to be done.”


OLIVER QUEEN
“Well, he's led a different life than we have, hasn't he? I can't expect him to know me like you do ... the places that I had sunk to, the depths you must have had to go to bring me back. Thank you.”


CHLOE SULLIVAN
“You proved it to yourself. Even with your face in the gutter, you still had the hero in your heart.”


OLIVER QUEEN
“You saved my life, Chloe. Both the myth ... and the man.”


FRANK
After this, the two grew closer - becoming more than just coworkers as Chloe started to move on from Jimmy’s death. 


KELLY SOUDERS
“Nobody expected Chlollie to show up, we were watching the dailies one day and there was a scene outside the cafe, and it was Oliver Queen and Chloe Sullivan, and all of a sudden all of us were thinking ‘are you guys seeking that? Did you just see what I just saw? There’s a chemistry, there’s sparks there. We got to get these two together and see what happens.”


FRANK
Season 9 would see Clark’s friendships survive tremendous challenges. Still haunted by the time travel that resulted in Jonathan Kent’s death, Clark refused to use the Legion ring and time travel to prevent Jimmy’s death, creating serious tension between him and Chloe for a while. Meanwhile, once Oliver came out of his spiral, he and Clark would overcome the tension that had come between them the prior season. 


OLIVER QUEEN
“You've done a hell of a job keeping the world safe on your own, Clark. I'm here to help you now.”


CLARK KENT
“Good. Something tells me ... soon the world will need all the help we can get.”


FRANK
The trio of Clark, Chloe, and Oliver would learn to work together as they faced a slew of DC characters - such as the Wonder Twins, Maxwell Lord, Roulette, the Silver Banshee, Icicle, and Mia Dearden (aka Speedy). But the biggest lessons in teamwork would be heralded by the first team of superheroes that ever appeared in comic books: the Justice Society of America.


HAWKMAN
“The Justice Society lives again.” 


CRAIG BYRNE
“Absolute Justice was brought to us from Geoff Johns, who was a major writer from the comic books. He actually had a meteor freak named after him in season four. In that episode, Geoff hinted at the camaraderie that this generation of heroes will need to have in order to face their challenges in the future.”


HAWKMAN
“You have the capacity to break the chains that are holding you down Clark. When you do, Dr. Fate and vision will come to pass. He will soar higher than any one of us.”


 KELLY SOUDERS
“Bringing in JLA, having Chloe create Watchtower, having Tess come around and become this, you know, force of good - it was definitely a conscious effort to have Clark surrounded by people and not having him isolated, because people can't do things in isolation. They really do need people to help them fight and they need people to be fighting for.”


PHIL MORRIS
“The name of it is Smallville. So it does take a village, you know. I think that's what this show brings up. When Clark gets too morose when he gets to, ‘Oh, woe is me. No one understands who I am.’ In comes somebody to reflect to him. ‘You're not alone in this. There are other heroes out here.’”


FRANK
The episodes “Society” and “Legends” were broadcast as a two-hour special event entitled “Absolute Justice”. It not only featured Geoff Johns’ return to Smallville, and the introduction of both the JSA - costumed Mystery Men who had operated in secret before being forced into retirement by the government in decades previous. It also introduced the government agency Checkmate - led by Amanda Waller, played by Pam Grier. Though the Suicide Squad would later appear in season ten, Waller’s time on the show would meet an abrupt end - with the character seemingly killed offscreen by Zod. This was due to the character’s upcoming appearance in the 2011 Green Lantern film, where she would be played by Angela Bassett.


Before her exit though, Waller would tease the next season’s big bad…


AMANDA WALLER
“This generation and the last are coming together, and I'm gonna need them if we're going to survive the Apokolips that's coming this way.”


FRANK
The apocalypse she spoke of was the planet Apokolips, established in Jack Kirby’s Fourth World comics series. Home of DC’s most-feared supervillain, Darkseid.


Waller understood that only the Justice League could take on Darkseid.


As would her mysterious opponent, whom Checkmate knew as the Red Queen.


MARTHA KENT
“If you're not careful, you'll end up on the wrong side of the coming Apokolips.”


FRANK
Fans didn’t think much of these references at the time, as their true implications seemed highly improbable for our little CW show that could. The first whispers of their true intent came when Geoff Johns dropped some coy hints on Twitter.


Still, fans wrote this off as the writer having fun with fans, until Watchtower‘s radar showed Oliver swarmed by dozens of enemies in the season finale - which observant fans recognized as parademons, Darkseid’s own version of flying monkeys.


OLIVER
“Chloe. They’re not Kandorians…”


FRANK
Pair that with a mysterious old woman entering Tess’ hospital room undetected after she had been declared dead following an altercation with Zod in the same episode. Fans recognized her as Granny Goodness, Darkseid’s fiercely loyal minion and leader of the Apokolips warrior group known as the Female Furies.


Tess had revealed she knew Clark’s secret in season 8. After assembling an Injustice Gang of meta humans to test Clark, season nine would reveal she was a Checkmate agent all along - and after running afoul of both her Checkmate superiors and Zod, her true motivations were finally revealed.


TESS MERCER - SACRIFICE
“I just wanted to save the world…”


FRANK
When asked about the season 9 finale, Cassidy Freeman herself was uncertain how and why her character - who had finally become an ally of sorts to Clark - would return from her apparent demise. She did however,  express hopes…


CASSIDY FREEMAN
“You know, I think it's going to be really interesting what they decided to do. I don't think they really fully know yet. I think they're still waiting on... you know, obviously a lot of the presumption has been about Granny Goodness and about Darkseid coming to the series. And I think there's a lot of politics and business that I'm not aware of, that go on with what characters they can bring to the series and what they can't. It seems like that's kind of the direction they want to go. And so I would be totally cool with coming back as Tess - I would be totally cool with coming back as a Female Fury.”


FRANK
The altercation with Zod that led to Tess’ apparent death came after her own meeting with Checkmate’s mysterious Red Queen - who would be revealed as none other than Martha Kent, as Annette O’Toole returned to the series after a three year absence. The Senator learned that the government was targeting alien threats, and did everything in her power to protect her alien son - from allying with John Jones and blackmailing Checkmate agent Maxwell Lord. 


MARTHA KENT
“Your father and I always trusted you to do the right thing. It seemed easier then. But now, what you're up against, when I went to Washington, I found there were forces working against you. I wanted to protect you. But I couldn't do it as Martha Kent. So I became the Red Queen.”


FRANK
During this visit, she also left Clark a suit. THE suit. Fans wouldn’t get a real glimpse until the next season, but the show treated them to a brief reflection of the suit in Clark’s eye in the season 9 finale. Both O’Toole and Martha weren't alone in their homecomings however, as they brought with them the long awaited return of Michael McKean as Perry White. 


PERRY WHITE
“Great Caesar’s Ghost!”


FRANK
The two had crossed paths again in Washington, and hit it off - beginning a relationship which was a nod to the actors’ real life marriage. This provided some awkwardness as Martha was flooded with memories of Jonathan when she returned to the farm, and Clark expressed hesitance to give Perry his blessing for a proposal. The two agreed to take a step back, maintaining their relationship from a distance as Perry took an editor’s position at one of the Daily Planet’s foreign desks. 


While in town, Perry teamed up with Lois on a story. Both reporters were eager to throw themselves into their work to distract from their respective relationship drama. It marked the beginning of an iconic working relationship.


LOIS
“What about you and Mrs. K.?”


PERRY WHITE
“Oh, I'm not giving up on her yet. Martha's one story I'm not sharing with anyone. So what do you say, kid. Africa?”


LOIS
“Normally, I would jump at the chance at running away from my problems. After one day in the trenches with Perry White, I realized I don't have to go anywhere to find my higher calling. I just- I needed to find the hero inside myself.”


PERRY WHITE
“Goodbye, Lane. You're the real deal.”


LOIS
“See you, chief.”


PERRY WHITE
“Oh, and, uh, tell Clark we're even. I owed him one from a long time ago.”


FRANK 
While Martha would return for guest appearances in the final season, this episode, “Hostage”, served as Michael McKean’s final on-camera appearance as Perry. He would later make a voiceover cameo in the series finale, and the character would also make appearances in the Season 11 comic continuation. 


ZOD
“Unlike you, I will lead from a throne, not from the shadows. Every human, including the woman you love, will kneel before Zod!”


CLARK
“You already destroyed my first home. I won't let you take this one.”


FRANK
The games of cat and mouse involving Clark and Zod, and Lois and the Blur, would also come to a head around this time - as Zod had begun impersonating the blur, and got close to Lois in an effort to gain intelligence on both Checkmate, and Clark himself.


And how did Zod receive his abilities once Clark destroyed his solar towers? Well, it actually harkened back to an episode earlier in the season. Heck, even continuity from several seasons prior. 


Alia, the follower of Zod who had come back from the future with Lois, mysteriously retained abilities under both a yellow and red sun. Deleted dialogue in the episode “Conspiracy” would have indicated this was a result of experimental procedures that Zod’s people were doing on Earth. The episode “Rabid” saw a rogue doctor unleashed a plague that put people into feral zombie-like states - only for them to be healed via Clark’s blood, much like Lionel and Adam Knight had been back in Season 3.


In “Conspiracy”, Zod would be shot by a conspiracy theorist who had targeted the Kandorians after he himself was revived in a manner similar to John Corbin. 


Honoring Jor-El’s last request to try and save this new version of Zod from going down the same path as his phantom self, Clark used his own blood to heal Zod from his fatal wounds.


And that’s when Zod’s superpowers would manifest. 


Zod would then use his own blood to grant abilities to his army after the death of Faora’s clone. Clark had convinced Faora that the Kandorians should assimilate into human society rather than rule. Zod killed her in a jealous rage, feeling like she had betrayed him by choosing Clark over him. In reality, she wanted a peaceful life where they could start fresh and raise their child. You see, while the original Zod & Faora created Doomsday on Krypton because they couldn’t conceive naturally, Faora’s clone in Smallville had become pregnant with Zod’s child. Unaware of all this, Zod was devastated to learn of the pregnancy when it was already too late - as his super hearing keyed in on Faora’s heartbeat fading - followed by that of their child.


Blaming Clark, Zod told his followers that the Blur and Checkmate were responsible for Faora’s death - and used her as a martyr to galvanize his army into taking over the earth. 


Meanwhile, Clark had obtained the Book of Rao from Martha - a mysterious artifact that Jor-El’s clone had hidden on Earth; and that was later discovered by Tess. 


The book was described as sort of a kryptonian Bible, and also possessed the power to transport all kryptonians to a New Krypton of sorts. 


Even though it would mean his own banishment, Clark planned to use it to protect the Earth - selflessly pushing Lois towards taking the job with Perry in Africa and entrusting the safety of the world to the Justice League.


CLARK KENT 
“The Kandorians have been led astray by Zod. I don't want to see them die any more than I want to lose any one of you. I will use the Book of Rao... ...to send them all away. I've made my decision. Once I lead my people to another world, I'll never be able to come back.”


CYBORG 
“You need to think about this.”


STARGIRL 
“What about your life here?” 


BLACK CANARY 
“There's got to be another way.”


HAWKMAN 
“With us by your side, you don't have to do this alone.”


CLARK KENT 
“This is the only peaceful way to eliminate the threat. Without a war, a war that no one will win... once the Kandorians are gone, there will be other threats to mankind. The world will need you. You'll have to work together to become the team that you were meant to be. I once believed that my destiny was here on Earth, but now you need to accept that destiny for me.”


BLACK CANARY 
“Clark's right.”


CYBORG 
“We'll protect the world… as one.”


CLARK KENT
“It has been my honor to serve alongside each and every one of you.”


HAWKMAN 
“The honor was ours, Kal-El.”


FRANK 
Zod discovered Clark’s intent and tried to have Lois steal the book of Rao - but our ace reporter smelled a rat.


ZOD
“I should've known better than to deceive The Blur's most devoted follower.”


LOIS LANE 
“Just who the hell are you?“


ZOD 
“Unlike The Blur, I'm someone who doesn't care whether you live or die.”


FRANK 
While Clark would save Lois, as the Blur he would give her a kiss goodbye - under the cover of the shadows. However, as soon as he sped off viewers were left with one of the series’ greatest cliffhangers - Lois had recognized it was Clark by his kiss.


LOIS LANE 
“…Clark!”


FRANK
As Clark and Zod continued their fight on a Metropolis rooftop, Clark tricked Zod to into admitting his murder of Faora, and in the heat of moment Zod overlooked the fact his followers now had superhearing. After eavesdropping on the confession, they turned on their leader - discharging themselves and promising Clark that the recently-promoted General Zod would see justice on New Krypton. 


As the book of rao was activated, a beam of light caused all the gathered kryptonians to ascend to the heavens.


All of them except for Clark, and Zod. 


ZOD 
“I told you. I'm not going anywhere.”


CLARK KENT
“You knew the blue kryptonite would prevent you from ascending like the others!”


ZOD
“Better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven.”


FRANK 
Zod had forged a blue Kryptonite dagger as a contingency - and in the episode’s closing moments he and Clark would have a bare knuckle throw down in the rain without superpowers. Fans had been somewhat disappointed by the quick fight with Doomsday in the season eight finale, and the crew worked tirelessly to make this one cinematic. In an ultimate act of sacrifice, Clark stopped resisting as Zod came at him with the dagger - instead helping the General plunge it into his side.


Zod briefly savored the moment of triumph before realizing Clark’s intent. 


With Clark staggering back and falling off the building -  Zod would be out of range of the blue Kryptonite’s effects and ascend to New Krypton with the other. 


As for Clark? Rather than pulling the dagger out and ascending with the rest of the kryptonians - he allowed himself to fall to the streets below. 


The episode cut to black as Clark plummeted in slow motion, arms outstretched, and a look of contentment on his face.


Over the summer break, fans speculated if someone else would fly in to catch him as he fell - be it John Jones, Hawkman, or even Kara - presuming the Book of Rao called her back to Earth. The wait would be agonizing but bittersweet, in that it would be the last season finale cliffhanger the show would ever deliver. 


CASSIDY FREEMAN
“I wasn't part of the first seven, but there were a lot of changes come season eight, you know, you had a lot of characters leaving you had you had the showrunners kind of being pared down to fewer people. And it was different and I think everyone was a little hesitant to take big steps, because they were afraid of what was going to happen. Also, Tom, I don't know if you know this - but Tom was only signed on for season eight. It wasn't until halfway through season eight that he actually signed on for two more years. So I thought and I think everybody else thought that season eight was going to be it. And so coming into season nine knowing that the network and the studio willing, we had a we had a Season 10 - I think that people were much more apt to take bigger chances. And when you get to like the eighth season of a show or the ninth season where you… I think you can take more liberties, and you don't have to be scared about taking big chances and I think it's what the fans want to be honest. You know, no one wants to watch the same thing for nine years. You want some chances taken.”


FRANK
Those chances and risks paid off. Season 10 was a go - and it was being promoted as the final season. Fans knew that when the show came back, the journey would be coming to an end. 


For a decade, viewers had watched as a boy grew into a man.  That man became a hero, and that hero would become a legend.


A Superman.

“Kneel before Zod, you bastard!”
